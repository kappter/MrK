    <h4>
    Year: 10, 11, 12
    <br>Credit: 1 CTE, Science, or Elective
    <br>Prerequisite: Computer Technology
    </h4>
    <p>Computer Science Principles is a new course that follows a project to develop a computer science course that seeks to broaden participation in computing and computer science. The course places emphasis on the principles of computer science rather than just programming.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Computer Programming I</h3>
    <h4>
    Year: 10, 11, 12
    <br>Credit: 1 CTE, 3rd Year Math, or Elective
    <br>Prerequisite: Computer Technology
    </h4>
    <p>An introductory course in computer programming/software engineering and applications. The course introduces students to the fundamentals of computer programming. Students will learn to design, code, and test their own programs while applying mathematical concepts. Introduction to programming language such as C++, C#, Java, Python, and Processing.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Computer Programming II</h3>
    <h4>
    Year: 11, 12
    <br>Credit: 1 CTE or Elective
    <br>Prerequisite: Computer Programming I
    </h4>
    <p>This is a second year programming/CS course catered to students pursuing IB/AP computer science. Students will continue the study of prominent object oriented languages including C++, Java and C# in preparation for the applicable state and/or AP/IB exams. Current hardware, operating systems, applied electronics and up to date IDE’s are all used in approaching highly technical and real world solutions resulting in skilled jobs and excellent education opportunities.</p>
